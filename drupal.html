           <p id="summary">During my time at Google, I spearheaded a project to bring attention to the usability issues of Drupal. We livestreamed a Drupal usability study to over 100 viewers, essentially turning user research into theater; lighting a fire under the Drupal community’s you-know-what to focus on usability concerns.</p>


    <h3>The Situation</h3>

    <p>Drupal is an open source content management system that powers high-profile websites like WhiteHouse.gov. I’ve been building websites with Drupal and a Drupal consultant since 2008.</p>

    <p>Though incredibly flexible and robust in terms of capability, Drupal has never been easy to use, and has struggled to capture the Wordpress audience. Changing this would entail a cultural shift for the developer-centric Drupal community; a realization of the importance of usability and the need for user-driven development.</p>

    <p>The goal of this project was to make it painfully apparent to Drupal’s widespread, open-source community that critical attention was needed. Instead of using words, we livestreamed usability studies that gave every Drupal developer a front row seat to raw user pain. It was hard to watch but harder to turn away.</p>

<h3>The Process</h3>    
    <ul>
    <li>I sold the idea to the Google Open Source department, tying the study with Google’s name and giving it a higher profile. Here is <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XYgp1h33VOrnlAjOyEWOKwHQBywXB-W_7qTEt-EkxSo/edit#heading=h.vha8iy1ul5b0">the proposal</a> I gave them.</li>
    <li>My team consisted of Garen Checkley and Jen Lampton, two brilliant UX minds and fellow Drupalistas</li>
    <li>We create a task-based usability study to take users through some of Drupal’s most common interfaces but still left the study fairly open-ended. I was the facilitator for the studies while Jen and Garen took notes and kept everything running smooth. We posted an outline and <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/204868">our full script</a> on Drupal.org. We also compiled <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i7dJRnvj8Rk9zDwYCnTpQ7FNJ4TswFcJpyzWGGzrVm8/edit?pli=1">detailed background information</a> about all study participants to ground our study results.</li>
    <li>We promoted the study to the Drupal community by reaching out to Drupal heroes (like Angie Byron), and marketed it all over social media and Drupal.org</li>
    <li>We conducted 8 sessions, livestreamed them to over 100 people, and had a lively discussion going in IRC for people to share their reactions and feedback while it was happening</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1B7D6E805CE3A5A0">All of the recorded videos from the studies are on YouTube.</a> This allows us to refer to a precise moment, making it easier to share exact moments while referencing an issue</li>

    <h3>Outcomes</h3>


    <blockquote>Now that feeling of horror has been effectively crowd-sourced, the hope is that this will vastly increase the urgency that contributors feel around usability, so we can try and get some momentum in Drupal 8 towards solving these issues … The hope is also that other open source projects can really benefit from the trails that were blazed here.<footer>

    <ul>
        <li>We parsed all the issues into <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/218959">a polished usability report</a> and summarized our recommendations into four categories</li>

        <em>Screenshots from the report we released after the study</em>


        <li>We presented our findings at DrupalCon Denver (the annual biggest Drupal conference), and the Drupal community followed suit with numerous patches and code fixes. You can see <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/1427940">a detailed breakdown of the results on Drupal.org</a></li>
</li>
        <li>We wrote blog posts on the Google Open Source blog about the study, which gave both us and Drupal some extra visibility (check out the comments on these!)

        <li>Garen and I spoke with Robert Hokeman (author of Designing the Obvious) about how to best orient new users to Drupal. Based on our study results and Hokeman’s advice, we created wireframes of an initial walkthrough screen and shared them with the Drupal community. <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/files/Drupalcon-denver-2012-03-21-up-to-speed-aid-fireworks.png">(FireWorks file)</a></li>

        <li>If you work at a big company like Google, use that name to bring attention to something you care about</li>
        <li>Usability issues are best felt, not told</li>
    <li>Usability studies (with appropriate consent forms) can be turned into live theater</li>
        <li>It is possible to herd cats</li>
