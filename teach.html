           <p id="summary">As a self taught web developer, I love helping people on their journey to learning the web. I created course curriculum and taught web development to my coworkers at Google and also through the organization Black Girls Code.</p>


    <h3>The Situation</h3>

    <p>The thought of “building” the internet is intimidating and can seem out of reach. I am self-taught in all of my technical experience, and I love helping people in their journey learning the web.</p>

<p>Googlers are a tech-savvy bunch, but building websites is a specialized skill that many of my coworkers lacked. I wanted to create a class that felt fun, light-hearted, and achievable, and resulted in a finished project.</p>

<p>Black Girls Code (BGC) exists to empower women of color to ages 7-17 to become innovators in STEM fields. I met founder <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/champions/tech-inclusion/kimberly-bryant" target="_blank" title="Kimberly Bryant is honored by the Obama administration">Kimberly Bryant</a> when BGC was in it’s earliest days. I jumped at the opportunity to develop a curriculum with the BGC team to teach web development workshops.</p>

<h3>The Process</h3>
<p>When approaching something as big as “building websites”, it can be hard to pick out where to begin. Despite teaching to two very different audiences, my method and goals were largely the same:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pique their curiosity (excite)</li>
<li>Put the tools in their hands (empower)</li>
<li>Make sure they’re smiling (repeat)</li>
</ul>

<p>The course I designed at Google was an 8 week course, meeting weekly with homework. The workshops I taught for Black Girls Code were just 1 day (!), and in reality, that only gave me about 3 hours of class time. I developed different curricula for each of these, but both of them gave my students the opportunity to create, achieve, have fun, and continue the learning at home.</p>

<p>Two of my favorite takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>The power of metaphors. I had so much fun comparing topics like “CSS/JavaScript/HTML” to your skeleton, hair color, and gestures. I had a ridiculous metaphor to distinguish between margins and padding, you’ll have to ask me. These always got people smiling and laughing.</li>
<li>The power of visuals. Instead of inundating my younger students with HTML to type out to see in their browser, I had them start by just replacing images on existing webpages. They literally squealed in excitement! They were changing the web! I’ll never forget that.</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Outcomes</h3>

<ul>
<li>I taught multiple workshops for Black Girls Code using <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-eyXYzibvpeY3Jhdy13YkhQMHFYVVFDdzQtM05kTi12cHE0/edit">these slides</a> and a whole lot of enthusiasm!</li>

<p>Check out this quick video to learn more about Black Girls Code, and see clips of me teaching! This was filmed during my class, and most of the girls you see were my students :)</p>

<li>My class at Google went great. One of my students told me it was the first time she was really able to wrap her head around web technologies. Here are a selection of some of my lessons:
    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://technicka.net/sites/technicka.net/files/article/2011/im-teaching-class-called-designing-web/designingforthewebclass-0.pdf" target="_blank">Introduction to web design and the languages of the web</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://technicka.net/sites/technicka.net/files/article/2012/im-teaching-class-called-designing-web/designingtheweb-class2.pdf" target="_blank">Understanding CSS and how it talks to HTML</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://technicka.net/sites/technicka.net/files/article/2012/im-teaching-class-called-designing-web/designing-web-3.pdf" target="_blank">Visualizing the power of CSS and understanding inheritance and specificity</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://technicka.net/sites/technicka.net/files/article/2012/im-teaching-class-called-designing-web/designing-web-4.pdf" target="_blank">Sizing elements with margins, padding and the box model</a></li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>The Moral</h3>
<ul>
<li>In my experience, technical subjects are not often taught in a way that is light-hearted and fun. I found great success teaching in an opposite style.</li>
<li>You are never done learning, even if you’re the teacher. I learned so much from students, which made me a better teacher, and gave me a fresh perspective on using the web</li>
<li>It’s crazy how much exposure kids have to the web these days compared to 15 years ago. Wow.</li>
</ul>
